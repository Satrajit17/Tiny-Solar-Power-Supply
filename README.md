# Tiny-Solar-Power-Supply
Designed a compact solar-powered boost converter that steps up a 1.2 V AA battery to a regulated 3.3 V using the AP3015 IC. Implemented automatic solar/battery switching with MOSFET control, created the PCB in KiCad, and generated Gerber files for fabrication. Applied skills in power electronics, PCB layout, and sustainable IoT design.
